SAP recommends a code push down of your ABAP logic to the HANA database to have a better performance. One of the possible ways to do this is to use AMDPs (ABAP Managed Database Procedures). They can be developed in Eclipse. SAP unfortunately does not provide a Pretty Printer (source code formatter) for it. For this reason I developed an AMDP Pretty Printer in my spare time. You can use it for free under the MIT licence (see [Installation](doc/Installation/README.md) for more details).
